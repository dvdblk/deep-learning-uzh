# 01 - Perceptron Learning

## Task

1. Generate two separable normal distributed datasets in 2D
2. Label one dataset with `-1` and the other with `1`
3. Shuffle both datasets together
4. Implement the perceptron with `numpy` matrices
5. Initialize perceptron weights randomly
6. Define an appropriate stopping criterion
7. Apply perceptron learning rule to the data
8. Plot the samples and the learned decision boundary together
